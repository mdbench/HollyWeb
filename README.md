# HollyWeb
HollyWeb is a lightweight, deployable web application that lets users view and manage movie files from a browser.

## Why is it called HollyWeb?
Hollywood is the heart of the film community and HollyWeb was developed to provide a movie viewing experience using web technologies.

## Why do we need it?
Browsers have become state of the art applications. Many apps available on app stores can be made with wider compatibility for fractions of the code-base and energy. HollyWeb is only 530 lines of code at its base. Cybersecurity is getting harder and harder to achieve and an offline web app makes hacking virtually impossible, a breath of fresh air in a time of insecurity.
